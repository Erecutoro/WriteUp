# WASM

WASM (WebAssembly) is assembly but in web meaning that we wont get the file and we will work directly with your web browser.

## Given data

    Get your flag at http://reverse.blackfoot.io:1331 !

## Solution

We can see that there is strcmp function in the wasm file so we will try to exploit this.

Place a breakpoint on the address 0x143 (in the strcmp function).
Now input a value in the field and checkout the result in the scopes section.
var3 is the value our input are compared to here 43's value is 'd' and we go on and on until we get the flag.
